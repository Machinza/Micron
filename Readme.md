# Printed parts, manual, CAD
Your main source of information is Hartk's GitHub repo: https://github.com/PrintersForAnts/Micron. Please read through this document before you start printing your parts, as there are some modifications we recommend.

# Toolhead
The default toolhead for our kit is the Dragonburner with an Orbiter extruder. You can get the files at https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/V0/Dragon_Burner

If using the Pancake toolhead board and harness you can get the toolhead board mount at https://github.com/christophmuellerorg/voron_0_pancake_board

If using an EBB36 CAN board we recommend the mount by KayosMaker at https://github.com/KayosMaker/CANboard_Mounts/tree/main/STLs/BTT_EBB36_1.0_Mounts

# Toolhead mount & probe
We recommend using Boop as the toolhead mount and Z probe/endstop. You can get the files at https://github.com/PrintersForAnts/Boop/tree/main

# Screen
We recommend the BTT TFT43 screen if you're using a Raspberry Pi (not the BTT Pi). You will need:
- The files in the BTT_TFT43 folder in this repository
- The front skirt and accent files from https://github.com/PrintersForAnts/Micron/tree/main/Mods/hartk1213/180/Waveshare4.3
