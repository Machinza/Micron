TOOLHEAD
The default toolhead for our kit is the Dragonburner with an Orbiter extruder. You can get the files at https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/V0/Dragon_Burner

If using the Pancake board with the toolhead harness you can get the toolhead board mount at https://github.com/christophmuellerorg/voron_0_pancake_board

If using an EBB36 CAN board we can recommend the mount by KayosMaker at https://github.com/KayosMaker/CANboard_Mounts/tree/main/STLs/BTT_EBB36_1.0_Mounts
